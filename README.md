Wellbeing (when I'm stressed ... I need...) (general needs eg. kids, illness, sleep etc)

- Ming stress profile, will be quiet, will ask brother and facilitator for help, will speak up early before getting to that part. To do, check in on Ming if he gets too quiet.

- Jeff stress profile, starts to become avoidant, avoids talking about the difficult thing, lower chance of that happening based on past experience. To do, separate Jeff from the work/have a break.

- Jordan stress profile, same as Jeff for stress signs. To do, separate Jordan from the work/have a break.

- Kris stress profile, similar to Ming, withdraw or get frustrated. To do, check in when you can see that or talk about something slightly off topic to distract/destress.

- Ryan stress profile, will get quiet when stressed with addition of moving around in the chair. To do, first give some space then check in.  


Expectation setting and agreements (what do we each want out of this time, what hours will we keep, what do we do when conflict arises, how will we communicate, especially what hours work will happen over the weekend)

What do we want out of this time

- To solidify work, process around learning new tech, Fun and a fun team environment.

What hours will we keep

- Reasonable hours 9-5. One day on the weekend to be off. Kris and Jeff ideally not Saturday, Jordan and Ryan ideally not Sunday, Ming can do either. Ideally Saturday will be the extra work day if project demands it. Option to stay late, end of day check in to decide.

What do we do when conflict arises

- Pokemon battles on showdown to destress. Talk it out. Sit as a group and communicate as a group. Making sure there is a majority vote if the conflict is decision based. 

How will you make decisions together? How will you handle conflict?

- Decision making - get in a group around a white board and talk about it. With having a majority vote. 

How will you, individually and as a team, get the help you need both technically and non-technically?

- First ask the group for help and set time box for group help if needed, Google for solutions, Consulate facilitator help or ask family who are in tech for help. 

How will you make sure everyone feels included?

- Make sure people have time to speak, Listen to each other, Let the person finish their idea before inputting, Run by group if there are separate meetings and decisions are made. 

How will you decide who needs to be present for which conversations

- Meeting by meeting basis, based on the components that are being worked on. If it doesn’t involve you, you don’t need to be there, but are welcomed to stay if it's something to learn.
